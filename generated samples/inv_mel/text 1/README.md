Audio, synthesised for *"Massachusetts Institute of Technology may be best known for its math, science and engineering education"* in different configurations.

### Structure

`usual_audio_1.wav`: usual generated audio, with speed, pitch and energy equal to 1.0 (100%)

`pitch=0.8_1.wav`: -20% for pitch

`pitch=1.2_1.wav`: +20% for pitch

`speed=0.8_1.wav`: -20% for speed

`speed=1.2_1.wav`: +20% for speed

`energy=0.8_1.wav`: -20% for energy

`energy=1.2_1.wav`: +20% for energy

`speed=0.8_pitch=0.8_energy=0.8_1.wav`: -20% for pitch, speed and energy together

`speed=1.2_pitch=1.2_energy=1.2_1.wav`: +20% for pitch, speed and energy together
